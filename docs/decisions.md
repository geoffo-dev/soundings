# Decisions log

A running log of product decisions and simplifications, newest section last. Anything
that shapes the architecture also gets an ADR ([adr/](adr/README.md)); this file is for
the smaller calls that would otherwise live only in a chat. Guiding rule from SPEC:
**simple beats configurable**. Status: **Decided**, or **Proposed** (the lead's default,
awaiting the product owner; build it this way unless told otherwise).

## 2026-09-30 · Phase 0

### Answers to SPEC section 16 (Decided, [ADR 0009](adr/0009-product-name-and-open-questions.md))

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| Product name, logo, colours | **Soundings**. Calm neutral greys, one accent (deep ocean blue `#1d5fa8`), Inter bundled. Wordmark only; admins upload a logo. |
| Can members volunteer to own ideas? | Yes, when the project allows it: `allow_volunteer_owners`, default `true`. |
| Who can be an evaluator? | Project members with role `member` or `admin` only (direct or via group). |
| Evaluation window and reminders | Due 7 days after the first invite (per-project `default_evaluation_days`). Reminders 2 days before and on the due date, fixed. |
| Classification markings | None. |

### Things we chose not to build (SPEC non-goals, Decided)

- Configurable workflow engines, custom fields, per-project stage designers. The five
  statuses are fixed; admins may only rename labels.
- Webhooks, duplicate detection, file attachments (possible later, not now).
- Multi-organisation tenancy: one instance is one organisation; projects separate work.
- Our own LLM integration: all AI goes through kagent (A2A + our MCP server).
- Classification markings (section 16 answer).
- Configurable reminder schedules, digest times or notification types beyond the
  per-type immediate / daily digest / off preference.

### Simplifications and defaults set while writing the role matrix

| Decision | Status | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Only platform admins create projects (and name the first project admin). | Proposed | One organisation per instance; keeps project sprawl in check. Easy to widen later. |
| "Anonymous" submission means the public form (`/{project}/submit`), which signed-in users can use too. The internal form always records the submitter. | Proposed | Avoids a second anonymity concept with its own visibility rules. |
| Submitters may edit their idea only while it is `new`; the owner and admins can edit until it is closed (admins always). | Decided | Evaluators score what they read; edits after that go through the accountable owner. |
| Blind evaluation is never lifted by a role, and closing evaluation doesn't lift it for evaluators who never submitted. | Decided | One rule, no exceptions, easy to test ([role matrix §3](role-matrix.md#3-blind-evaluation-exact-visibility-rules)). |
| Emails never contain scores, for anyone. | Decided | Removes a whole class of blind-evaluation leaks; emails link to the app. |
| Other people's evaluator progress is shown as submitted / not submitted; "draft" is visible only to its author. | Decided | Draft status carries no useful signal for others. |
| Admin actions (members, rubric, settings, platform, API keys) are session-only, never available to API keys. | Decided | Keys are for automation and agents; admin changes stay in the audited UI. |
| Owner/evaluator assignment needs a real project role; being platform admin is not enough. | Decided | Keeps assignment lists meaningful; platform admins add themselves as members first. |
| Only the owner and admins can trigger AI evaluation, research and drafting. | Proposed | AI runs cost money and write into the idea; the accountable owner decides. |
| Members (not viewers) can suggest proposal section text; the owner accepts or discards it. | Decided | Same mechanism as AI drafting, so no extra concept. |
| Viewers and internal non-members can watch ideas and export proposals. | Decided | Both are reads; watching only affects their own notifications. |
| Denials: 404 when you may not know the resource exists, 403 when you can see it but not act, 409/422 for state and input conditions. | Decided | Private projects don't leak; clients get a stable `code`. |

### Engineering choices made with the Phase 0 research

| Decision | Status | Reference |
|---|---|---|
| psycopg 3 is the only Postgres driver (no asyncpg), shared by SQLAlchemy and procrastinate. | Decided | [ADR 0002](adr/0002-backend-stack.md) |
| Email outbox table + in-transaction job defer; capped exponential retry. | Decided | [ADR 0003](adr/0003-background-jobs-procrastinate-and-email-outbox.md) |
| Target kagent **v0.10.2** (`kagent.dev/v1alpha2`); talk A2A through `a2a-sdk` (1.0 with 0.3 fallback); re-verify against the installed cluster in Phase 6. | Decided | [research R2](research/kagent-a2a-claude-code-frontend.md) |
| MCP server uses `mcp` 2.x (`MCPServer`), stateless JSON mode, exact-path route at `/mcp`, POST only. | Decided | [research R1](research/backend-libraries.md) |
| Pin TypeScript 5.9.x (7.x breaks typescript-eslint and openapi-typescript); MSW 2.15 rather than the 2-day-old 3.0; Playwright 1.56.1 to match the pre-installed Chromium. | Decided | research R2 |
| Proposal editor: one native `<textarea>` per template section with Write/Preview, no editor library. | Decided | research R2 (CodeMirror +172 KB, md-editor +361 KB gzip) |
| Components are hand-written on the unified `radix-ui` package; no shadcn CLI. | Decided | [ADR 0007](adr/0007-hand-built-design-system-on-radix.md) |
| SPEC's "security-reviewer" is the `code-reviewer` agent type (it covers OWASP ASVS L2). | Decided | [ownership.md](ownership.md) |
| ALTCHA: Python `altcha` 2.x with the `altcha@3` widget, random mode, cost ~5,000; store used challenge signatures until expiry (no built-in replay protection). | Decided | research R1 |
